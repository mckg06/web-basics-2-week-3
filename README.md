## Instructions

### Getting Started:

Clone this repository so that the code is available on your local machine:

> **Note:** Run this command from the directory where you want to store your code (ex. `lessons/`)

    git clone git@github.com:Code-the-Dream-School/web-basics-2-week-3-[your-username].git

Navigate to the directory you just cloned in your terminal:

    cd web-basics-2-week-3-[your-username]

Create a new local branch to work on separate from the mainline branch (`master`):

    git checkout -b assignment

Finally, open the project directory in your code editor and continue to the next section.

### Task List:

Ready for a fun challenge? This week you will be creating a Battleship game in JavaScript.

Battleship is a war-themed game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of each other's warships and sink them.

> If you've never played Battleship before, you can learn more in the [official rule book](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/battleship.pdf).

Stage the JavaScript file that you edited:

    git add index.js

Create a commit for the changes you made and add a message:

    git commit -m "write your message here"

Push your branch to the remote repository (visible in GitHub):

    git push origin assignment

Create a Pull Request in GitHub and request feedback:

1. Navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab in your repository
2. Click the "New pull request" button
3. Set the base branch to `master` and the compare branch to `assignment`
4. Click the "Create pull request" button
